            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PAPISTS St. Dominick and his Rosary: OR, A Full Discovery of all the <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Forgeries</hi> imposed by him on the <hi>People,</hi> which the <hi>Politick Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> of his <hi>Successors</hi> have continued to this day in the Church of Rome.</head>
            <p>CErtainly there was not a devouter Man than St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick,</hi> in all the <hi>Legends</hi> of the <hi>Popish Saints.</hi> Now you shall hear what this <hi>Whoreson</hi> did. In his time the <hi>Albigenses</hi> were a great Eye-sore to the <hi>Pope.</hi> These People were a sort of honest orderly People, that lived in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that is to say, at the foot of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> that car'd not neither for Crosses nor Holy Water, nor Reads, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, nor, to tell ye the truth, for the <hi>Pope</hi> himself. Now if 'twould vex a Saint to see his Copy-hold so touch'd, no wonder the <hi>Pope</hi> was so enrag'd at these good People. The <hi>Pope</hi> therefore hearing of the great Fame of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> for St. <hi>Dominick</hi> was no small fool in those days; he was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as if he had been her <hi>Cousin German;</hi> and she had such an Affection for him, that she gave him a notable Wit, a Silver Tongue, and a Brazen Face; and many other such Trinkets. And if he had a mind to work a Miracle at any time, it was but whispering the <hi>Virgin</hi> in the Ear with an <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> or two in the next Room, and the business was done; so that his fame far exceeded Dr. <hi>Faustus</hi>'s, who wrought with the Devil. The <hi>Pope</hi> therefore, I say, hearing of the great fame of this same St. <hi>Dominick,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64362:3"/> sent him with all speed to charm and conjure down those Hobgoblins of <hi>Albigenses,</hi> that did so terrifie his Fancy. A way went St. <hi>Dominick</hi> with his <hi>Thunderbolts,</hi> and his <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's,</hi> and his <hi>Bulls,</hi> his <hi>Comminations</hi> and <hi>Execrations,</hi> and what not. But all these trifles frightned the <hi>Albigenses</hi> no more than a verse out of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> written in a piece of Paper, will terrifie an Ague. So that St. <hi>Dominick</hi> fearing to lose his Credit, repairs to his old friend in a corner the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and tells her how the case stood. She no sooner heard his Voice, but she came tripping presently down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in her Morning Gown, and appearing before him. <hi>Friend</hi> Dominick, quo she, <hi>what's the matter? The</hi> Devil, quo he, <hi>the</hi> Devil <hi>is got among the</hi> Albigenses. <hi>Is he so?</hi> quo she, <hi>no matter for that; do but thou go and preach the</hi> Rosary <hi>among 'em, and thou shalt see all the Swine in the Countrey never leave trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till they all meet at the general Rendevouze in the Lake of</hi> Geneva. <hi>Ay,</hi> quo <hi>St.</hi> Dominick; <hi>is that the trick on't? And by the Mass I'll try it.</hi> With that he went incontiently and preach'd the <hi>Rosary,</hi> and converted above a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Hereticks, before a Cat could lick her Ear: That is to say, to whisper ye in the Ear, as a friend. He went and advis'd the <hi>Pope</hi> to set his Mastiffs, the Neighbouring Princes upon 'em, who being once incourag'd with a sanctifi'd <hi>Hallou,</hi> set upon those poor naked Creatures with their Armed Bands, and murder'd much about the number before specified. And this way of Conversion was cry'd up for a Miracle; and when they thought the Fact had been almost forgotten, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd, <hi>St.</hi> Dominick's <hi>Preaching the Rosary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you'll say, what a Devil is this <hi>Rosary?</hi> Why then thus, St. <hi>Dominick</hi> observing the great benefit and good success of his <hi>preaching the Rosary,</hi> and that thereby he had very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled the World, resolv'd to recruit it again; to which purpose he erected a <hi>Sodality</hi> of <hi>Virgins,</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Immaculate Lady</hi> of the <hi>Rosary.</hi> And these Female <hi>Sodalities</hi> were to be erected in no other place, but where the <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Fryers,</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> had a Mansion. And now, Friend, I hope you smell a Rat, if ye do, tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Dominick</hi> were not a good natur'd man, and did not deserve to be a <hi>Saint,</hi> to provide so well for his Family.</p>
            <p>But you don't tell me all this while what this <hi>Rosary</hi> is—
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64362:3"/> Why look ye—if you will believe, after I have told ye that and a little more, that the Papists and their Teacher are both Knaves and Fools, and that their Religion is nothing but Folly and Knavery, as I do, and not take their parts as a Company of People, without Sense or Wit, about the Town do. I'll tell ye the whole business, here is such a piece of Pious Gullery and Imposture, that if there were no other Religion in the World besides that of Popery, a man would swear there were none at all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rosary</hi> then is a certain Form of Praying to God in Honour of his <hi>Blessed Mother. For I tell ye, there's nothing to be done without her; she's Queen Regent of Heaven, and governs all things there, as if her Son were a Minor, at the age of 1680 years.</hi> This <hi>Rosary</hi> consists of 150 <hi>Ave Marie's,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Davids Psalter,</hi> that consists of 150 Psalms; and if <hi>David</hi> had written 150 more Psalms, you had had 150 more Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>in the Rosary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is divided into 15 <hi>Tens</hi> or <hi>Decades,</hi> and every <hi>Decade</hi> contains 10 <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and 1 <hi>Pater Noster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By which Papistical Proportion, the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>is 9 times more Honourable than her Son. And thus you see what he has got among the Papists by coming into the World to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: The Protestants therefore are of another belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It contains two sorts of Prayers, <hi>Mental</hi> and <hi>Vocal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A very great ease to the Subject. For thus Women may play at</hi> L'antre Lou, <hi>and Men talk Polities at a Coffee House, and think their Prayers, both at one Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Common People may say them in the best Fashion they can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Never did Mountebank give plainer Directions for the taking a Scorbutic Pill,</hi> however you see 'tis good easie <hi>Soul-physick</hi> and a <hi>Sick-conscienc'd</hi> Man may go abroad with it, without catching cold.</p>
            <p>It contains 15 Mysteries; among the rest; the Incarnation, Crucifixion and Ascension; but the two last, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the chiefest, according to the mode of Papistical Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are the Assumption of the Virgin Soul and Body; and how she was Crowned Queen of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>What would some men give to see a true Relation of this Solemnity? But thus you see how they <hi>hodge-podge</hi> their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64362:4"/> own sottish Superstitions and silly Humane Inventions with the most glorious Mysteries of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here they make the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of Heaven, and yet in some places you shall see her so poor, that she is not able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her self any more than an ordinary red Wastcoat. But you'll say there's a Mystery in that, sometimes she appears in her best cloaths to shew her Grandeur; sometimes in her worst to shew her Humility. Stories so ridiculous, even to some among themselves, that they have not spared to give out that St.</hi> Dominic's <hi>Tales were made at</hi> Geneva. <hi>But that excuse will not serve, for those Tales were in being long before</hi> Geneva <hi>was their Antagonist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most Remarkable Statutes of this Society are,</p>
            <p>That every Brother and Sister is bound to say a full <hi>Rosary</hi> twice a week, either at once, or by parts. And it may be said Kneeling, Standing, Lying or Sitting as opportunity will serve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That is in the very Act of Carnal Copulation it self, if need require.</hi> Or at the necessary House, where it stops a Dysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or relieves the hard bound, as occasion serves.</p>
            <p>If any one being hindred, cannot say his <hi>Rosary,</hi> and causes another to say it for him, he gains the Indulgences as if he had said it himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is an extraordinary convenience indeed. For a Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be taken up in good Company, and not have any leasure to serve God: I confess there is something of Morality in the case, for one man to come to another and say, Sir, I shall be busy all this day at a Gaming House, pray pray for me to day, and i'll do as much for you too morrow. But as for the Divinity of the Business, truly I think tis a meer Mockery of the God which they pretend to adore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now happy are they who are of this <hi>Sodality,</hi> Male and Female, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, Longtail and Bobtail; for let 'em Drab, Drink, Cheat, Lye, Game, do what they please, for no sins are excepted, they have Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences either plenary, or for so long time, which they will, upon the easiest Conditions imaginable. Herrings at 40 a groat were never so cheap as sins of Omission and Commssi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Rome:</hi> As for Example, If any Members of the <hi>Sodality</hi> are resolved to take their full swinge of the Pleasures of this Life, as often as they shall say a full <hi>Rosary</hi> they shall have a plenary Indulgence to save them harmless, by warrant of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64362:4"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> III. <hi>June</hi> 3, 1542; more added by other Popes 177 years, and 77 days of Pardon for every time. <hi>Now if any of these Sinners live 77 years, and commit</hi> 77000 <hi>crimes, and for every crime says a full</hi> Rosary, <hi>I would fain know how long they shall fairly keep out of Devils Clutches at</hi> 177 <hi>years and</hi> 77 <hi>days Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for each Offence?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Prisoners, Travellers and Servants, that cannot be present at the Processions of the <hi>Rosary,</hi> for every full <hi>Rosary</hi> they say shall gain a Plenary Indulgence, by warrant of <hi>Sixtus Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Jan.</hi> 30, 1586.</p>
            <p>Any of the <hi>Sodality,</hi> that either hears, says, or causes to be said, the <hi>Mass</hi> of the <hi>Rosary,</hi> beginning <hi>Salve Radix Sancta,</hi> shall have Indulgence as Plenary as if he had said a full <hi>Rosary;</hi> by warrant of <hi>Paul the Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of them do the same for a dead Brother or Sister, they not onely do themselves a kindness, but release a Soul out of Purgatory; by warrant of <hi>Alexander</hi> the VI.</p>
            <p>Nay if the Party deceas'd be not of the <hi>Sodality,</hi> yet if any of the Society shall but enter his Name in the <hi>Sodality-book,</hi> he shall have the benefit of his Friends Indulgences, whatever they be, as if he were living; by warrant of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>After all this, though any of the <hi>Sodality</hi> have liv'd never so wickedly, never so viciously, never so prophanely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64362:5"/> the least spark of Repentance, yet, when they came to die, if they have but once said the <hi>Rosary</hi> in their lives, and do but hold in their hands as they lye a dying, one of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles which are hallow'd in the <hi>Sodality,</hi> they shall have a Plenary Indulgence, saying only <hi>Jesu Maria;</hi> and such an <hi>Absolution,</hi> as to be restor'd thereby to the Purity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which they had in Baptisme, by the Warrants of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> VIII, <hi>Adrian</hi> VI, <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII, and <hi>Pius</hi> the V.</p>
            <p>Look ye, Gentlemen, hear are four of the Principal Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of Popes, that have given their Verdict for this Business, and you may find <hi>Sales-men</hi> I warrant ye anow, among the rest of the Tripple Crown'd Rout, to joyn with them. 'Tis a matter of no small Consolation to be so easily Sav'd, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for holding a Wax Candle in a mans hand upon his death bed. And therefore you may consider among your selves, whether the Authority be sufficient to oblige your belief. Could it be made out, the Wax-chandlers would be the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Company in <hi>London.</hi> What cunning ways they had in those days to Cheat the poor Devil? He, like an Oofe, stands gaping by the Beds side, ready to receive a Soul, when all of a sudden in comes a Fellow with a Wax-candle, puts it into the dying mans hand, bids him say, <hi>Jesus Maria,</hi> and then, Sirrah, cries he to the Devil, go about your business. You may be sure the Devil is not a little troubled to see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so baffled, but seeing no help nor no remedy, as blank as a Nonplus't Disputant, he claps his Tail between his Leggs, and steals away, glad that he can scape so too. What Golden Advantages must these of necessity be to the Coffers of <hi>Rome,</hi> when People have so little Wit, and such a world of deluded Faith, to be guided by such a Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Devotion as this; fabulous in the very fourth degree? Certainly there is not more sottish, more despicable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense, to be found among the <hi>Fakirs</hi> and <hi>Pagods</hi> of the <hi>Indians:</hi> Men of Reason, that never heard of these things, would have a greater Veneration for Mankind, then to think they could believe such Vanities: So that I look upon a bigotted Papist to be only a two-footed Brute. Certainly the rest must know better. For it is impossible that four Popes should be four such Fopps, to impose such a piece of Nonsensical Ribaldry as this upon any sort of People,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64362:5"/> had they not either very low thoughts of future Salvation, or that they found no other way in the World to establish their Authority, but upon the contempt of Heaven. That they may be Worshipt, they make Idols of themselves; that is, they have Eyes and Ears, but will neither hear nor see, and blind themselves, on purpose to misguide the blind into perpetual Ignorance, which is the Mother of two the foulest and most deformed Daughters in the World, <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superstition,</hi> the Mortal Enemies of that Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Spotless Virgin, True Divine Worship.</p>
            <p>But what is the reason of all this sottish ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Papists? Oh! read <hi>Mons. Sancy,</hi> and he'll tell ye. For says he, Go to an honest Protestant Divine, and ask him by what means a detestable sinner may be sav'd? He'll presently reply, by Embracing the Death of Christ, by Praying with a Contrite Heart and a true Repentance, <hi>&amp;c▪</hi> Ask a Jesuit concerning that nice sin of Sodomy, he'll fit your humour better then a Country Parson. He'll onely put the <hi>Rosary</hi> of the <hi>Immaculate Lady</hi> about your neck, and bid you say <hi>Domini Jesu, suscipe.</hi> And this Application rightly manag'd gives ye a full and absolute Indulgence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all your Sins, as well in reference to the Crime as the Punishment. And therefore 'tis no strange thing that the Papists should abhor the severe Religion of the Protestants, and embrace so kind and favourable a Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their own; by the freedom whereof the Gates of Paradice are always open at a minutes warning, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold as easily as the City Gates in the Night to a Six pence.</p>
            <p>Well then, my Masters, since ye must have <hi>Indulgences,</hi> I'll tell ye where ye may have them, and upon what days thorough all the Twelve Months. For you must know the Pope's Fair lasts all the year.</p>

            <p>I'll promise ye, a bonny brisk Trade, for you may be sure the Pope would never keep open Shop all the year long for nothing. And thus you see every great City and Town has its peculiar Commodities. <hi>Exeter, Taunton,</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi> for Serges and Stuffs, <hi>Colchester</hi> for Bays and Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>Chester</hi> for Cheese, <hi>Newcastle</hi> for Coals, <hi>Rippon</hi> for Spurs, <hi>Hereford</hi> for Cider, <hi>Tewkesbury</hi> for Mustard; and to go abroad, <hi>Norimbergh</hi> for Smiths Work, <hi>Montpellier</hi> for Tweezers, <hi>Caudebeck</hi> for Felts, <hi>Nants</hi> for Brandy, <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> for Mum, <hi>Venice</hi> for Treacle, <hi>cum multis aliis;</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> for Pardons and Indulgences.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the Pope has the Advantage of 'em all, in two respects; First, Because he deals chiefly in <hi>Soul-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,</hi> sells <hi>Purgatory, Paradice,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, which are every bodies money; and if one won't, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will. Secondly, Because he never trades upon Trust, but all for ready money; and so can have no losses, in regard no body can break in his Debt. But if men will be thus gull'd and fool'd, who can help it?</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to give ye one small Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because they are so much in fashion, for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good of all the Papists in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and so farewell.</p>

               <p>WHen the Heresie of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> (a Sect most injurious to the Thrice Sacred Virgin-Mother of God) infected the Countrey of <hi>Tholosa</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the holy Patriarch St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick,</hi> inspired by the Holy Ghost, came from <hi>Spain</hi> to preach against their Errors: Who finding great difficulty in their Conversion, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the most pure Virgin, whom he found to be still his gracious and particular Patroness; and fervently prayed her to shew him some means for their Reduction. The Mother of Mercy appeared unto him, and commanded him to preach the <hi>Rosary,</hi> as the aptest Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against Vice and Heresie; and most pleasing to God and her self. The which he performed with so good success, that he converted therewith more than an Hundred thousand Hereticks and Sinners.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Dominick</hi> seeing how beneficial this Devotion was to Souls, had a special care to see it flourish. He charged therefore his Order, the Friars Preachers, to teach it still unto the Christians, and they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured so well, that with great applause it was received of all sorts of people. So that now it is generally spread over all Christendom, and that the greatest Princes and Potentates do think it an honour for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be inrolled in the Sodality of the <hi>Rosary,</hi> as Servants devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Blessed Virgin; to whom it is so acceptable, that in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by her Intercession, God hath wrought innumerable Miracles for to favour it, as may be seen in sundry Books published to that effect. And sundry Popes considering the utility of this Devotion and Sodality, have confirmed and endowed it with divers great Priviledges and Indulgences, as here-under shall be seen.</p>

For to say it, you ought to take the Beads reverently in your Hands, blessing your self with the Cross at the end of it. And before you begin any <hi>Ten,</hi> to meditate a little upon the Mystery correspondent to it, recollecting your mind from outward Distractions. The common people, if they think this difficil, may say it in the best fashion they can, directing their intention to the glory of God, and honour of his Blessed Mother.</p>

               <p>But what say the Monks and Friers, and the whole Chiurme of Popish Divinity?
